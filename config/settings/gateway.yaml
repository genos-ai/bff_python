# Gateway Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Available options:
#   default_policy    - Access policy for all channels (string: allow_all|allowlist|deny)
#                       allow_all  = no gateway-level restrictions (development)
#                       allowlist  = only users in the channel's allowlist (production)
#                       deny       = block all traffic through gateway
#   channels          - Per-channel configuration (object, keyed by channel name)
#     <channel_name>  - Channel name matching features.yaml (e.g., telegram, slack)
#       allowlist     - User IDs allowed when policy is "allowlist" (list of integers)
#
#   Note: Channel-level auth (e.g., telegram.authorized_users in application.yaml)
#   is enforced separately by channel middlewares. This gateway-level policy is an
#   additional layer checked at startup.
